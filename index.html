    <h1>Aishwarya Prakash</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Aish (short for Aishwarya) and I'm terrified of the social media. But, I'm still craving to discuss everything I find exciting. So, I did the next best thing! I made this new website to share everything I love - Marketing, Art and Stories in between!</p>
